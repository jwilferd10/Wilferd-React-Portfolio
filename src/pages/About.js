                        Hello, I'm Jonathan Wilferd, I'm a former student at UCLA Extensions Coding Bootcamp. 
                        I entered the class with minimal understanding on coding but came out with a much better comprehension to software development as a whole.
                        I took the journey one step and one line of code at a time. 
                    </p>
