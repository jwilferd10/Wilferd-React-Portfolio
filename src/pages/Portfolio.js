                        <p>NoFT is an environment where users can share, favorite, download, and discuss all of their favorite NFT works without actually interacting with any real non-fungible tokens. No changes to the chain-of-title, no interaction with cryptocurrency wallets, no financial transactions of any kind.</p>

                        <p class="desc-team-member">Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles usersâ€™ financial information. Like most challenges I've worked on in the past, this introduction into PWA's was best described as grueling despite some understanding how the concepts work. However putting it into practice somehow proved to be harder then I expected, but thankfully after investing the time to overcome the issues that did pop up I do certainly feel like I've learned a whole lot in this particular experience.</p>
