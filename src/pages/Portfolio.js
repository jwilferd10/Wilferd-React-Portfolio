                    Hello, I'm Jonathan Wilferd, I'm a former student at UCLA Extensions Coding Bootcamp. 
                    I entered the class with minimal understanding on coding but came out with a much better comprehension to software development as a whole.
                    I took the journey one step and one line of code at a time.
