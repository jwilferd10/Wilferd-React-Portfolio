## Description:
<p>"Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects."</p>

<p>I was tasked to create a personalized portfolio for myself using React. This is to showcase understanding in newer technology. One of the requirements for this challenge was to deploy it to GitHub Pages, but unfortunately I had more problems getting this deployed through pages then actually setting up the entire portfolio. So to remedy this, I set it up on Heroku instead! </p>

<p>I had an incredible time setting up the portfolio, I've plans on revamping this entire project when I have a bit more time so that it showcases what I'm truly capable of. There are some issues with this current version, the About page has a hard time rendering on the phone but the other pages work perfectly fine. </p>

## :book: User Story:
**AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications**
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

**GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer**
- WHEN I load the portfolio
  - THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
- WHEN I view the header
  - THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
- WHEN I view the navigation titles
  - THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- WHEN I click on a navigation title
  - THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
- WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
  - THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
- WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
  - THEN I see a recent photo of the developer and a short bio about them
- WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
  - THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
- WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
  - THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
- WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
  - THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
- WHEN I enter text into the email address field
  - THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
- WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
  - THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
- WHEN I view the footer
  - THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
